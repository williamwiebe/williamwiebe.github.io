        Using a network of microphones dispersed throughout a city, ShotSpotter
        triangulates the location of a gunshot by comparing the distance from
        its point of origin to the three closest microphones. ShotSpotter
        installs and maintains these systems themselves, renting access to local
        police departments. Besides real-time surveillance, the proprietary data
        which ShotSpotter collects is fed into the company's machine learning
        dataset and spun off into predictive policing programs which police
        departments may also subscribe to. Given the fallibility of the system,
        the data is regularly retrofit by human analysts to substantiate the
        claims made by police officers in court.

        <em>Chekhov's Gun</em> stars a group of technical support engineers
        employed by ShotSpotter to visually confirm that the soundwaves selected
        by ShotSpotter's machine classification are gunfire and that the time
        signatures have been correctly synced for echolocation. In the film, the
        three employees rehearse a dialogue based on court transcripts in which
        ShotSpotter employees testify to the efficacy of the gunshot detection
        system; their staging anticipates the triangulation of gunfire. The film
        installation includes screenprints marking moments of mishearing in the
        testimony, a bench padded with acoustic foam, and an acoustic diffuser
        produced from a Chicago homicide prediction map.

        A series of acoustic interventions used a purpose-built parametric
        speaker and an adapted form of Morse code to communicate with
        ShotSpotter's technical support engineers via their own gunshot training
        dataset, isolating an individual microphone in Chicago from its intended
        function in the network. The waveforms of these interventions were
        encoded for compact disc—the technological standard for courtroom
        evidence—and reproduced as embossings.
