          Using a network of microphones dispersed throughout a city,
          ShotSpotter triangulates the location of a gunshot by comparing the
          distance from its point of origin to the three closest microphones.
          ShotSpotter installs and maintains these systems themselves, renting
          access to local police departments, which pay per square mile of
          coverage. The microphones suffer from selective hearing: police
          departments are only willing to pay to listen to certain communities.
          Besides real-time surveillance, the proprietary data which ShotSpotter
          collects is fed into the company's machine learning dataset and spun
          off into predictive policing programs which police departments may
          also subscribe to. Given the fallibility of the system, the data is
          regularly retrofit by human analysts to substantiate the claims made
          by police officers in court.

          The film <em>Chekhov's Gun</em> stars a group of technical support
          engineers employed by ShotSpotter to visually confirm that the
          soundwaves selected by ShotSpotter's machine classification are
          gunfire and that the time signatures have been correctly synced for
          echolocation. The three employees rehearse a dialogue based on court
          transcripts in which ShotSpotter employees testify to the efficacy of
          the gunshot detection system; their staging anticipates the
          triangulation of gunfire. The film installation includes screenprints
          marking moments of mishearing in the testimony, a bench padded with
          acoustic foam, and an acoustic diffuser produced from a Chicago
          gunshot prediction map, altering the acoustic texture of the
          exhibition space.

          A series of acoustic interventions used a purpose-built parametric
          speaker to communicate with ShotSpotter's technical support engineers
          via their own gunshot training dataset, isolating an individual
          microphone in Chicago from its intended function in the network. The
          waveforms of these interventions were encoded for compact disc—the
          technological standard for courtroom evidence—and reproduced as
          embossings.
