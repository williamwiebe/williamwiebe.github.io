          European Council Regulation No. 866/2004 establishes special rules for
          the areas of Cyprus “temporarily outside the area of freedom, justice
          and security,” permitting the temporary introduction of goods from
          Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus into the Republic of Cyprus if they
          are to be exhibited or used at a public event. Following the
          procedures enumerated by the regulation, a group of objects
          collectively exceeding the reporting threshold of €260 were trafficked
          into the Republic of Cyprus, accompanied by an auction catalogue
          “providing reasonable evidence” of their intended exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the period of their statutory exhibition at the NeMe Arts
          Centre in Limassol (Republic of Cyprus), the objects were offered for
          sale for €260.01 each, on the condition of their long-term loan to the
          S.N.K. Venus Home Developers Ltd (liquidated 2011) Study Collection in
          Pyla, a bicommunal village within the United Nations buffer zone.
          Those objects remain subject to confiscation by the Customs
          Authorities of the Republic of Cyprus today.
