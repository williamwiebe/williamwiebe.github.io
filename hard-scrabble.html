        <p>
          Two franchises of perceptual technology articulate one another:
          anechoic experiments developed by James Turrell in 1968 while in
          residence at a defense contractor are scored for the ShotSpotter
          acoustic surveillance sensor that oversees his Chicago “Skyspace,”
          <em>Hard Scrabble Sky</em>. The ShotSpotter sensor and the Skyspace
          interact as multiples, networked architectures that derive meaning and
          purpose through one’s knowledge of their iteration—one vision of a
          public, or a future, premised on the hearing of another.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scores are encoded for compact disc—the technological standard for
          courtroom evidence—and reproduced as embossings alongside
          documentation images.
