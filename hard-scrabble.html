          Two franchises of military perceptual technology articulate one
          another: acoustic experiments developed by James Turrell while in
          residence at a defense contractor in 1968 are played back to the
          ShotSpotter acoustic surveillance sensor that oversees his Chicago
          "Skyspace,"" <em>Hard Scrabble Sky</em>. Both the ShotSpotter and the
          Skyspace interact as multiples, each a component in a network of
          architectures that derive meaning and purpose through one's knowledge
          of their iteration, one vision of a public, or a future, premised on
          the hearing of another.
