          Two forms of public sculpture punctuate the intersection of Roosevelt
          and Halsted Streets in Chicago. Inset from the street, James Turrell’s
          <em>Hard Scrabble Sky</em> perches on a foundation of stilts, framing,
          in Turrell’s characteristic style, an oval of the sky above.
          Streetside, the monopod of a ShotSpotter sensor projects away from the
          lightpost to which it is sutured, framing another waveform, the
          concentration and dissipation of sound below it. Both the ShotSpotter
          and the Skyspace (Turrell’s name for his signature interventions)
          interact as multiples, each one a component in a network of
          architectures that derive meaning and purpose through their iteration,
          through your knowledge of their iteration. What does their copresence,
          their adjacence, signify as a token of gentrification, of
          overpolicing? And how do the sculptures exist in a relationship of
          interdependence, one vision of a public, or a future, premised on the
          hearing of another?
