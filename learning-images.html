          <em>Visual Inspection Zone</em> borrows from a series of promotional
          images of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg produced during a “refugee
          simulation” at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2010. Using a
          software package developed and disseminated by passport
          counterfeiters, Sheryl’s identity is combined with the biometric
          information of passports and identity cards trafficked on the dark web
          until a plausible hybrid identity is achieved. The "Visual Inspection
          Zone" is the non-machine-readable portion of a passport’s identity
          page: moving between the images, the audience constructs a third
          identity between Sheryl and her inadvertent proxies (Erika, Alessia,
          Sozan, Raghda, Lily, Zahra, and Sheera)—the border officer.

          <em>SMPLverse</em> NFTs use facial recognition to match users to
          images synthesized by Microsoft to train face tracking algorithms for
          its mixed reality headsets. Like many NFT projects, Microsoft’s
          dataset was procedurally-generated from a library of digital assets:
          from a template 3D face model, 100,000 images were rendered with
          random identities, expressions, textures, hair, clothing, and
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Synthetic data is increasingly used to train computer vision
          algorithms because it is diverse and perfectly labeled by design. In
          mixed reality headsets, these algorithms communicate the slightest
          expressions of bodily reality to virtual images. The synthetic data on
          which these algorithms are trained are the medium of this
          communication, the skins we wear on the metaverse’s computational
          layer. Though the figures in Microsoft’s dataset resemble the avatars
          that populate the metaverse’s surface, they function as avatars for
          the infrastructure along which all other avatars travel.

          If the fundamental problem animating NFT projects consists of
          investing images with new identities and realities,
          <em>SMPLverse</em> elaborates the ultimate indifference of our
          images—corporeal and otherwise—to those identifications.
