          The fifth preference EB-5 visa provides a path to citizenship for
          alien investors who make an investment of capital not less than the
          statutory minimum in a new commercial enterprise “which will benefit
          the United States economy” and “create permanent, full-time
          employment” for at least 10 qualifying U.S. workers in the United
          States. The EB-5 program allows the state to extract monopoly rent on
          its exclusive territorial sovereignty and its prerogative power of
          immigration enforcement; the evaporation of traditional real estate
          financing since the 2008 financial crisis has made major development
          projects reliant on the program to maintain favorable profit margins.

          An exhibition is staged in a donated real estate venue constructed
          under the EB-5 program. The venue is left open to the public for the
          exhibition duration.
