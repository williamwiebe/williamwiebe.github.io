<em>Taking Longer and Producing Less</em> turns on a set of custom mail-order envelopes, collated as a series of images by the United States Postal Service’s universal mail imaging program. Inverting the practice of the “poor man’s copyright,” whereby one mails a copy of one's work to oneself to prove the date of an idea’s conception, the data extracted by the imaging program becomes the intellectual property of USPS. Consumers may distribute this information only insofar as is necessary “to explain or effectuate a Postal Service transaction”: how then to enlist these transactions self-reflexively as agents of distribution, overflowing the model of information-as-a-service?
</p>
<p style="max-width:900px;">
While a letter is always a mode of direct address, the model of one-to-one communication belies the vast, distributed forms of intelligence that rationalize the movement of information in contemporary postal systems. <em>Taking Longer and Producing Less</em> takes up these different modes of sociality, displacing the local relationship between correspondents to the general intelligence of the network. The work itself is embedded in the mutable digital objects the USPS servers store and which the envelopes and images refer to.
