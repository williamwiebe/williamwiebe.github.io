        <em>SMPLverse</em> NFTs use facial recognition to match users to images
        synthesized by Microsoft to train face tracking algorithms for its mixed
        reality headsets. Like many NFT projects, Microsoft's dataset was
        procedurally-generated from a library of digital assets: from a template
        3D face model, 100,000 images were rendered with random identities,
        expressions, textures, hair, clothing, and environments.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 900px">
        Synthetic data is increasingly used to train computer vision algorithms
        because it is diverse and perfectly labeled by design. In mixed reality
        headsets, these algorithms communicate the slightest expressions of
        bodily reality to virtual images. The synthetic data on which these
        algorithms are trained are the medium of this communication, the skins
        we wear on the metaverse's computational layer. The figures in
        Microsoft's dataset resemble the avatars that populate the metaverse's
        surface, yet they function as avatars for the centralized infrastructure
        along which all other avatars travel.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 900px">
        If the fundamental problem animating NFT projects consists of investing
        an image with new identities and realities,
        <em>SMPLverse</em> questions the possibility of controlling one's image
        in a context where the prevailing modes of representation are determined
        by the market. Trafficking in the conventions of the NFT market,
        <em>SMPLverse</em> frees Microsoft's images to have experiences which
        their original creators had never dreamed of. Yet even in this parallel
        existence, the images never wholly abandon their indifference to our
        identifications. No matter what we do to them, they will never be real.
