          <em>Visual Inspection Zone</em> borrows from a series of promotional
          images of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg produced during a “refugee
          simulation” at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2010. The
          imaginary scenario documented by the publicity image—the spectacular
          violence of the border regime—is inverted into a new documentary of
          the fictional images constructed by passport counterfeiters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a software package developed and disseminated by passport
          counterfeiters, Sheryl's identity is combined with the biometric
          information of passports and identity cards trafficked on the dark web
          until a plausible hybrid identity is achieved. The "Visual Inspection
          Zone" is the non-machine-readable portion of a passport's identity
          page: moving between the images, the audience constructs a third
          identity between Sheryl and her inadvertent proxies (Erika, Alessia,
          Sozan, Raghda, Lily, Zahra, and Sheera)—the border officer.

          <em>SMPLverse</em> NFTs use facial recognition to match users to
          images synthesized by Microsoft to train face tracking algorithms for
          its mixed reality headsets. Like many NFT projects, Microsoft's
          dataset was procedurally-generated from a library of digital assets:
          from a template 3D face model, 100,000 images were rendered with
          random identities, expressions, textures, hair, clothing, and
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Synthetic data is increasingly used to train computer vision
          algorithms because it is diverse and perfectly labeled by design. In
          mixed reality headsets, these algorithms communicate the slightest
          expressions of bodily reality to virtual images. The synthetic data on
          which these algorithms are trained are the medium of this
          communication, the skins we wear on the metaverse's computational
          layer. Though the figures in Microsoft's dataset resemble the avatars
          that populate the metaverse's surface, they function as avatars for
          the infrastructure along which all other avatars travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the fundamental problem animating NFT projects consists of
          investing images with new identities and realities,
          <em>SMPLverse</em> elaborates the ultimate indifference of our
          images—corporeal and otherwise—to those identifications.

          left at the exhibition space. Visitors who return an envelope by mail
          with their information are sent a set of 18 artist-designed envelopes
          from the exhibition space on its letterhead. The work is the animation

          The fifth preference EB-5 visa provides a path to citizenship for
          alien investors who make an investment of capital not less than the
          statutory minimum in a new commercial enterprise “which will benefit
          the United States economy” and “create permanent, full-time
          employment” for at least 10 qualifying U.S. workers in the United
          States. The EB-5 program allows the state to extract monopoly rent on
          its exclusive territorial sovereignty and its prerogative power of
          immigration enforcement; the evaporation of traditional real estate
          financing since the 2008 financial crisis has made major development
          projects reliant on the program to maintain favorable profit margins.
        </p>
        <p>
          An exhibition is staged in a donated real estate venue constructed
          under the EB-5 program. The venue is left open to the public for the
          exhibition duration.

          <em>Provisional Readymades</em> takes up the temporal structure of the
          exhibition to temporarily introduce goods from Turkish-occupied
          northern Cyprus into the sovereign Republic of Cyprus. In accordance
          with the procedures enumerated by European Council Regulation No.
          866/2004, which establishes special rules for those areas of Cyprus
          “temporarily outside the area of freedom, justice and security,” the
          goods were accompanied by an auction catalogue “providing reasonable
          evidence” of their intended exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
          After their mandatory exhibition period at the NeMe Arts Centre in
          Limassol (Republic of Cyprus), the objects were placed on long-term
          loan to S.N.K. Venus Home Developers Ltd (liquidated 2011) in Pyla, a
          bicommunal village located in the United Nations buffer zone.

          Using a network of microphones dispersed throughout a city,
          ShotSpotter triangulates the location of a gunshot by comparing the
          distance from its point of origin to the three closest microphones.
          ShotSpotter installs and maintains these systems themselves, renting
          access to local police departments, which pay per square mile of
          coverage. The microphones suffer from selective hearing: police
          departments are only willing to pay to listen to certain communities.
          Besides real-time surveillance, the proprietary data which ShotSpotter
          collects is fed into the company's machine learning dataset and spun
          off into predictive policing programs which police departments may
          also subscribe to. Given the fallibility of the system, the data is
          regularly retrofit by human analysts to substantiate the claims made
          by police officers in court.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film <em>Chekhov's Gun</em> stars a group of technical support
          engineers employed by ShotSpotter to visually confirm that the
          soundwaves selected by ShotSpotter's machine classification are
          gunfire and that the time signatures have been correctly synced for
          echolocation. The three employees rehearse a dialogue based on court
          transcripts in which ShotSpotter employees testify to the efficacy of
          the gunshot detection system; their staging anticipates the
          triangulation of gunfire. The film installation includes screenprints
          marking moments of mishearing in the testimony, a bench padded with
          acoustic foam, and an acoustic diffuser produced from a Chicago
          gunshot prediction map, altering the acoustic texture of the
          exhibition space.
        </p>
        <p>
          A series of acoustic interventions used a purpose-built parametric
          speaker to communicate with ShotSpotter's technical support engineers
          via their own gunshot training dataset, isolating an individual
          microphone in Chicago from its intended function in the network. The
          waveforms of these interventions were encoded for compact disc—the
          technological standard for courtroom evidence—and reproduced as
          embossings.
