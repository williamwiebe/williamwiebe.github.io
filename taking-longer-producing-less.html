        <em>Taking Longer and Producing Less</em> turns on a set of custom
        mail-order envelopes, photographed by the United States Postal Service's
        universal mail imaging program—the earliest commercial computer vision
        application. Composed of mirrored paper, the envelopes look back at the
        imaging machine as they transit through the postal network.

        Inverting the practice of the “poor man's copyright,” whereby one mails
        a copy of one's work to oneself to prove the date of an idea's
        conception, the data extracted by the imaging program becomes the
        intellectual property of USPS. Consumers may distribute this information
        only insofar as is necessary “to explain or effectuate a Postal Service
        transaction.” Overcoming the prevailing model of
        information-as-a-service, the work enlists these transactions as the
        instruments of its production and distribution alike.
